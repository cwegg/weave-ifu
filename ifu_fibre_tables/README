IFU fibre tables
================

The IFU fibre tables describe the (relative) position of the fibres in the focal
plane for each LIFU/mIFU bundles as well the different IDs assigned to each
fibre.

These assets are centrally stored (and version controlled) in the WEAVE data
model repository and this is why they have not been included in this directory.

The contents of this directory are the following scripts related with that
files:

 * plot_fibre_table.py :
   Plot the LIFU and mIFU fibre tables into PDF files.
