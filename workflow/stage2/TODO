- Diagram of the workflow should be modified to reflect that PROGTEMP and
  OBSTEMP are used in this stage (instead of stage 3).

  This information will be properly updated with the information from an
  auxiliar file in the future.
- Default value for binning_X should be included in the blank XML template.
- field.RA_d and field.Dec_d for LIFU to be discussed between DM, DT and LPdA.
