	   It is WEAVE policy to "lock" the arms: ie, the Red and Blue
	   arms must be observed with the same exposures within an OB.
           WEAVE science teams are permitted a limited subset of the
           below exposure options. PI surveys may use other
           combinations at their own risk.

           PROGTEMP = "32332" (MOS, HR-Green, R:5x18mins, B:5x18mins, x2 spectral binning)
           Some RB combinations might be restricted due to excessive readout overheads, eg:
           PROGTEMP = "23601" (MOS, HR-Blue, R:12x10mins, B:1x120m)
	   The red arm here would incur a significant overhead readout penalty, and would not be completed at around the same time as the blue arm.

           This component is entirely optional - XMLChecking will not
           fail if there is no X value in the PROGTEMP.
           If a survey wishes to duplicate this OB, then they can add
           the .X directive onto the end of the PROGTEMP
           code.
           Furthermore, if users want to "chain" these OBs together,
           such that the observation of one of these clones increases
           the chance that the remaining OBs in this group are
           observed, then a "+" can be added to the end of PROGTEMP.
           The "+" instructs the WEAVE Scheduler to increase the
           (internal, survey-specific) weight of all OBs in this
           group. This provides a mechanism to ensure that once a
           series of observations are started, completion of the chain
           becomes a progressively higher priority above other OBs
           from this survey.
           Some examples:
           PROGTEMP = "11331.4" - Create 4 OBs with the fibre configuraion as defined in this XML
	   PROGTEMP = "11331.4+" - As above, but probabilistically link them to ensure the chain is completed
