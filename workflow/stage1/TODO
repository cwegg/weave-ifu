- Agree the maximum size for offsets (it also affects stage 3). In
  *check_ifu_driver_cat.py*, we have assumed offset_tol_arcsec=10.0.
- Double check the sizes of the circles used in *plot_ifu_driver_cat.py* once
  the part of the data model with such information is stable.
- Consider to feed *plot_ifu_driver_cat.py* with a local progtemp.dat file.
