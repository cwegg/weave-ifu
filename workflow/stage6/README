**Contributors:** Luis Peralta, Yago Ascasibar, Scott Trager

Input, auxiliar files and output
--------------------------------

* **Input:**

  + An IFU FITS catalogue populated with the information available in the XML
    files created with configure.

* **Output:**

  + A fully-populated IFU FITS catalogue.


Software
--------

* *check_populated_ifu_fits_cat.py*:

  A Python script/function to check a fully-populated FITS catalogue versus a
  non-populated version. It allows to detect potential undesired changes
  produced at this stage.

* *photometry_from_PS1.py* / *add_PS1_photometry.py*:

  Python scripts to download and photometer PanSTARRS1 *gri* FITS images to provide integrated-fibre photometry for each fibre in a configuration. The *photometry_from_PS1.py* script also sets the TARGUSE key to `S' if the fibre has an integrated magnitude of *r*â‰¥24.0 mag, as this is likely well below sky. Turn this off if you do not want this behaviour.
